## SOLVE A BUSINESS PROBLEM USING OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES LIKE LINEAR PROGRAMMING AND PYTHON LIBRARIES LIKE PULP 

DELIVERABLE: A NOTEBOOK DEMONSTRATING THE PROBLEM SETUP, SOLUTION, AND INSIGHTS

Solving a business problem using optimization techniques, particularly Linear Programming (LP), with Python is a powerful approach to making data-driven and cost-effective decisions. These techniques allow businesses to optimize outcomes such as minimizing cost, maximizing profit, or improving efficiency under specific constraints like limited resources, time, or capacity. A typical deliverable for such a project is a Jupyter Notebook that clearly explains the problem context, formulates the mathematical model, solves it using Python optimization libraries, and interprets the results with actionable insights. This structured and reproducible approach not only enhances transparency in decision-making but also showcases technical and analytical skills in a practical, business-oriented way.

The primary platform for implementing this task is Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, which are highly suited for combining code execution, mathematical formulation, documentation, and visualizations in a single interactive document. These environments allow users to sequentially build and explain their models while enabling readers to follow the logic intuitively. Another popular platform is Google Colab, a free, cloud-based notebook environment that doesn’t require any setup and is accessible from any browser. It is especially useful for collaboration, as it supports sharing and real-time editing similar to Google Docs. For users who prefer traditional IDEs, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Jupyter extension or PyCharm Professional Edition also provides a robust environment for developing, testing, and debugging optimization scripts, though they may lack some of the interactive features of native notebook environments.

In terms of libraries, PuLP is one of the most effective and user-friendly Python libraries for formulating and solving LP and MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problems. PuLP allows you to define decision variables, constraints, and objective functions using a Pythonic syntax that is readable and easy to interpret. It can interface with a variety of solvers, including open-source options like CBC (Coin-or branch and cut) and commercial solvers like Gurobi or CPLEX. Another useful library is SciPy.optimize, which includes the linprog function for solving linear programming problems with a more mathematical interface. For more advanced use cases, such as vehicle routing or scheduling, Google OR-Tools is a robust alternative that provides tools for a wide range of optimization problems.

Supporting libraries like NumPy and Pandas are essential for data manipulation, especially when input data is sourced from CSV files, databases, or APIs. These tools enable users to organize and structure data into formats suitable for modeling. For presenting results and performing sensitivity analyses, visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly are used to create charts and graphs that help communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders. These visuals are particularly helpful in showing how changes in constraints or objective coefficients impact the optimal solution.

Throughout the process, documentation and explanation play a crucial role. Markdown cells in Jupyter Notebooks are used to write problem statements, describe model assumptions, explain the mathematical formulation, and present business insights. The notebook should also include interpretation of the model output—such as what the optimal values of the decision variables mean in a real-world context, what trade-offs are involved, and how the solution can be implemented operationally. For example, a linear programming model might determine the optimal mix of products to manufacture given limited labor and material resources, minimizing total production cost while meeting demand. Such a model can directly influence production planning and resource allocation strategies.

In conclusion, solving a business problem using optimization techniques with Python involves a comprehensive set of tools and platforms tailored to data analysis, model building, and communication. Platforms like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and VS Code provide the environment for development, while libraries such as PuLP, NumPy, and Pandas offer the computational power needed to formulate and solve complex optimization problems. Visualization tools further enhance understanding, and proper documentation ensures the insights are actionable. This workflow not only addresses specific business challenges but also demonstrates a methodical approach to problem-solving that is both transparent and replicable.
